## About The Project

[![Product Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/sha-reen-04/labour-link-job-platform)

In a tech-focused job market, non-technical roles often go unnoticed despite their vital contributions to organizational success. **Labour-Link** seeks to bridge this gap by offering a dedicated platform where companies can post jobs and job seekers can find opportunities aligned with their skills â€” especially in customer service, sales, and administration.
